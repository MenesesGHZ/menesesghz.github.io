ID: mnist
name: MNIST with Artificial Neruronal Network
description: A basic Artificial Neuronal Network from scratch to deal with MNIST task (Recognition of Handwritten Digits). This artificial neruonal network only contains two layers, the input layer with 784 nodes wich is fully connected with the output layer with 10 nodes, without any activation function. By default the ANN was only trained with 19,000 images instead of the 60,000 images in total. Further if you want to improve the accuracy of the predictions you are welcome to train the model.
