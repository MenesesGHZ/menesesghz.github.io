ID: knn
name: KNN implementation with Python
description: Implementation of a classification algorithm, call it KNN, which belongs to supervised learning paradigm of the tree main types of learning in machine learning. It uses the euclidean norm to calculate the distance among all neighbours with respect to the unknown neighbour. The implementation was made with python, and the purpose of the "project" itself, it was for pure academic demonstration.
