ID: snake3d
name: Snake 3D - Reinforcement Learning
description: The project itself consists in the recreation of the classic video-game <strong>"The Snake" into a 3D scenarium</strong>. Implementing the computer graphics with the support of  <strong>Three.js</strong> library, developing the mechanics of the 3D environment from scratch. More over the project has the implementation of a  reinforcement learning algorithm, using the Monte Carlo Methods theory describe by <strong>S. Sutton and G. Barto</strong> in their book "Reinforcement Learning an Introduction". Specifically the project has the algorithmic implementation of <strong>Monte Carlo Exploring Starts.</strong> In general, this method seeks to find the best action to take in a certain state, mapping a certain action, which is going to maximize the reward in a long term, with a respective state.
